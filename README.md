## Description:

    AS the owner of XYZ corporation, I need a way to easily find non-sensitive information from my employees. This shows the employees picture, name, email, user-ID, city, state and country (since my employees reside in CA as well). It also lets me sort by first name and last name AS WELL AS search by name (either first or last).

## Dependencies:

    Built with React, Font_Awesome, Axios, Bootstrap, RandomUserAPI, react-bootstrap.
